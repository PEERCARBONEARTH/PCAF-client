    "answer": "The motor-vehicle loan asset class covers all on-balance-sheet loans and lines of credit to businesses and consumers that finance one or several motor vehicles. It includes passenger cars, motorcycles, light/heavy commercial trucks, buses, recreational vehicles, boats, and even yellow equipment (earth-moving vehicles). The methodology allows institutions to define their own scope of vehicle types and requires transparent disclosure of any exclusions.",
