# Enhanced Climate Scenarios - Dynamic Portfolio-Based Analysis

## âœ… **Implementation Complete**

I've significantly enhanced the Climate Scenarios section with comprehensive, portfolio-specific climate scenario analysis that dynamically adapts to each bank's unique portfolio composition, showing only relevant scenarios with actionable, AI-powered guidance.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Enhancements**

- **EV Exposure Bonus**: +2% to +8% based on EV percentage
- **Hybrid Vehicle Bonus**: +3% for portfolios >15% hybrid
- **ICE Exposure Penalty**: -1% to -3% based on ICE concentration
- **Data Quality Bonus**: +10% confidence for PCAF score â‰¤3.0

#### **Disorderly Transition Scenario**
- **Base Impact**: -8% (sudden policy changes)
- **ICE Exposure Penalty**: -5% to -8% for high ICE concentration
- **High-Emission Vehicle Risk**: -3% to -6% for truck/SUV concentration
- **EV Protection Bonus**: +2% to +4% for EV exposure
- **Geographic Risk**: -2% for high concentration

#### **Hot House World Scenario**
- **Base Impact**: -15% (severe physical risks)
- **Geographic Concentration Penalty**: -4% to -8% for regional exposure
- **EV Infrastructure Bonus**: +3% for high EV exposure
- **High-Emission Double Impact**: -5% for combined physical/transition risk
- **Data Quality Penalty**: -2% for poor risk assessment capability

### **3. Dynamic Portfolio Metrics Dashboard**
Real-time calculation and display of:

#### **EV Exposure**
- Percentage of electric vehicle loans
- Provides upside in all transition scenarios
- AI tooltip explains scenario benefits

#### **ICE Exposure**
- Percentage of internal combustion engine loans
- Higher exposure increases transition risk
- AI tooltip explains vulnerability factors

#### **Geographic Concentration**
- Maximum percentage of loans in single state
- Affects physical risk exposure
- AI tooltip explains climate event vulnerability

#### **Data Quality Score**
- Average PCAF data quality across portfolio
- Affects scenario modeling accuracy
- AI tooltip explains confidence implications

### **4. Dynamic Scenario Cards**
Each scenario card adapts based on portfolio analysis:

#### **Color-Coded Impact**
- **Green**: Positive impact scenarios (orderly transition upside)
- **Orange**: Moderate negative impact
- **Red**: Severe negative impact

#### **Portfolio-Specific Drivers**
- Shows only relevant drivers for each portfolio
- Examples:
  - "High EV exposure captures green finance opportunities"
  - "High ICE exposure vulnerable to sudden policy changes"
  - "Geographic diversification provides climate resilience"

#### **Confidence Scoring**
- Dynamic confidence based on data quality and portfolio composition
- Higher EV exposure = higher orderly scenario confidence
- Better data quality = higher overall confidence

### **5. Portfolio-Specific Strategic Recommendations**
Only shows recommendations relevant to the specific portfolio:

#### **Capitalize on Transition Upside** (Only for portfolios with >5% positive orderly impact)
- Accelerate green financing programs
- Market sustainable finance capabilities
- Expand EV financing partnerships

#### **Critical: Disorderly Transition Risk** (Only for portfolios with <-10% disorderly impact)
- Implement stress testing for policy changes
- Develop transition financing programs
- Consider portfolio rebalancing

#### **Physical Risk Mitigation** (Only for portfolios with <-20% hot house impact)
- Diversify geographic lending
- Assess borrower weather exposure
- Include climate factors in underwriting

#### **Improve Scenario Modeling Accuracy** (Only for portfolios with >4.0 data quality score)
- Implement systematic data collection
- Invest in staff training
- Create customer data incentives

#### **Well-Balanced Portfolio** (Only for resilient portfolios)
- Maintain diversification strategy
- Continue gradual transition
- Monitor scenario developments

## ðŸ¤– **AI Integration Features**

### **Contextual Tooltips**
Every scenario metric includes AI-powered explanations:
- **Scenario impact drivers** specific to portfolio composition
- **Portfolio resilience factors** and vulnerability analysis
- **Confidence levels** based on data quality and modeling accuracy
- **Strategic implications** for each scenario outcome

### **Dynamic Content Generation**
- **No static content** - all impacts calculated from real portfolio data
- **Portfolio-aware scenarios** - only shows relevant drivers and risks
- **Composition-based impacts** - scenario effects determined by actual vehicle mix
- **Geographic-sensitive** - physical risks based on actual loan locations

## ðŸ“Š **Scenario Calculation Logic**

### **EV Exposure Benefits (Orderly Scenario)**
```
if evPercentage > 20: orderlyImpact += 8
elif evPercentage > 10: orderlyImpact += 5
elif evPercentage > 5: orderlyImpact += 2
```

### **ICE Exposure Risks (Disorderly Scenario)**
```
if icePercentage > 80: disorderlyImpact -= 8
elif icePercentage > 60: disorderlyImpact -= 5
elif icePercentage < 40: disorderlyImpact += 3
```

### **Geographic Physical Risks (Hot House Scenario)**
```
if geographicConcentration > 50: hothouseImpact -= 8
elif geographicConcentration > 30: hothouseImpact -= 4
else: hothouseImpact += 3
```

### **Data Quality Confidence Adjustment**
```
if avgDataQuality <= 3.0: confidence += 0.1
elif avgDataQuality >= 4.5: confidence -= 0.1
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Experience**

### **Portfolio-Specific Display**
- **High EV portfolios**: See significant orderly transition upside
- **High ICE portfolios**: See disorderly transition warnings
- **Geographically concentrated**: See physical risk alerts
- **Well-diversified**: See balanced resilience messaging

### **Dynamic Recommendations**
- **Only relevant actions** - no generic advice
- **Severity-based urgency** - critical alerts for high-risk portfolios
- **Opportunity highlighting** - growth strategies for well-positioned portfolios

### **Actionable Intelligence**
- **Immediate actions**: For high-risk scenario exposures
- **Strategic planning**: For medium-term scenario preparation
- **Opportunity capture**: For scenario-based competitive advantages

## ðŸš€ **Regulatory Alignment**

### **NGFS Scenario Framework**
- **Orderly Transition**: Early coordinated climate policy
- **Disorderly Transition**: Late uncoordinated climate policy
- **Hot House World**: Limited climate action with severe physical risks

### **Banking Supervision Compliance**
- Comprehensive scenario analysis capability
- Portfolio-specific risk assessment
- Transparent methodology and assumptions
- Actionable risk management recommendations
