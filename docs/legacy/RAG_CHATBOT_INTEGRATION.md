AI: Analyzes current portfolio â†’ Identifies specific loans needing improvement â†’ Provides actionable recommendations
```

### **2. PCAF Methodology Guidance**
```
User: "What are PCAF Options 1-5?"
AI: Retrieves from knowledge base â†’ Explains each option â†’ Suggests best path for user's situation
```

### **3. Compliance Support**

## Technical Architecture

### **RAG Pipeline**
1. **User Query** â†’ Intent detection and mode selection
2. **Portfolio Context** â†’ Loads current portfolio data if relevant
3. **ChromaDB Search** â†’ Retrieves relevant knowledge base entries
4. **AI Response** â†’ Generates contextual response with sources
5. **Follow-up Questions** â†’ Suggests related queries

### **Fallback Strategy**
```typescript
try {
  // Primary: ChromaDB RAG API
  const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/api/chroma/rag-query`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ query: content, portfolioContext })
  });
} catch (chromaError) {
  // Fallback: AI service
  const response = await aiChatService.processMessage({
    sessionId, message: content, context
  });
}
```

### **Portfolio Integration**
```typescript
// Auto-detects when portfolio context is needed
const needsPortfolio = content.toLowerCase().includes('my') || 
                      content.toLowerCase().includes('portfolio') ||
                      sessionType === 'portfolio_analysis';

if (needsPortfolio) {
  const { loans, summary } = await portfolioService.getPortfolioSummary();
  // Analyzes data quality, compliance, improvement opportunities
}
```
