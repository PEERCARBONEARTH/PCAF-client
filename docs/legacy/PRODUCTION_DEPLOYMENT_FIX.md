# Production Deployment Fix Required ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Issue Summary

**Error**: `Uncaught ReferenceError: useAssumptions is not defined`
**Location**: Production deployment at `https://pcaf-client.vercel.app/`
**Status**: Fixed in local code, needs production deployment

## Root Cause Analysis

The production deployment is still using an **old version** of the code that had the missing import issue. While we've fixed the issue locally, the production environment hasn't been updated with the latest changes.

## Local Fix Status ‚úÖ

All files using `useAssumptions` now have proper imports:

### ‚úÖ Fixed Files:
1. **AIInsights.tsx** - Added missing import
2. **PortfolioOverviewDashboard.tsx** - Import verified ‚úÖ
3. **LoanDetailView.tsx** - Import verified ‚úÖ
4. **AssumptionsBuilder.tsx** - Import verified ‚úÖ
5. **AssumptionsNudge.tsx** - Import verified ‚úÖ
6. **AssumptionsDrawer.tsx** - Import verified ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Context Setup:
- **AssumptionsContext.tsx** - Properly exports `useAssumptions` hook
- **App.tsx** - `AssumptionsProvider` correctly wraps financed emissions routes

### ‚úÖ Build Verification:
- Local build successful ‚úÖ
- No TypeScript errors ‚úÖ
- All imports resolved ‚úÖ

## Production Deployment Required üöÄ

### Current State:
- **Local Environment**: ‚úÖ Fixed and working
- **Production Environment**: ‚ùå Still has old code with missing import

### Required Action:
**Deploy the latest code to production** to resolve the runtime error.

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
If connected to Git, push the latest changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add missing useAssumptions import in AIInsights.tsx"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Trigger a new deployment on Vercel
3. Verify the deployment uses the latest commit

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the fix:

1. **Visit Production URL**: `https://pcaf-client.vercel.app/`
2. **Navigate to AI Insights**: `/financed-emissions/ai-insights`
3. **Check Console**: Should be no `useAssumptions is not defined` errors
4. **Test Functionality**: AI Insights page should load correctly

## Error Details

### Before Fix:
```javascript
// ‚ùå Missing import in AIInsights.tsx
const { hasTargetsConfigured } = useAssumptions(); // ReferenceError!
```

### After Fix:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Proper import added
import { useAssumptions } from "@/contexts/AssumptionsContext";

const { hasTargetsConfigured } = useAssumptions(); // Works correctly
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before Deployment:
- ‚ùå AI Insights page crashes on load
- ‚ùå Runtime error in production
- ‚ùå Poor user experience
- ‚ùå Application unusable for AI features

### After Deployment:
- ‚úÖ AI Insights page loads correctly
- ‚úÖ No runtime errors
- ‚úÖ Smooth user experience
- ‚úÖ Full application functionality restored

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `src/pages/financed-emissions/AIInsights.tsx` - Added missing import

### Import Added:
```typescript
import { useAssumptions } from "@/contexts/AssumptionsContext";
```

### Context Usage:
```typescript
const { hasTargetsConfigured } = useAssumptions();
```

### Provider Setup (Already Correct):
```typescript
// In App.tsx
<AssumptionsProvider>
  <FinancedEmissionsRoutes />
</AssumptionsProvider>
```

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:
- ‚úÖ No console errors related to `useAssumptions`
- ‚úÖ AI Insights page loads successfully
- ‚úÖ Context values are properly accessible
- ‚úÖ All assumption-related features work correctly

## Summary

The `useAssumptions is not defined` error has been **completely resolved** in the local codebase. The issue now is purely a **deployment synchronization problem** where production is running outdated code.

**Next Step**: Deploy the latest code to production to resolve the runtime error and restore full application functionality.
