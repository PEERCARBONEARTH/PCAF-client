## üìä **Sample Narrative Insight Types**

### **1. Portfolio Optimization**
```
Title: "Portfolio Optimization Opportunity for Community Bank"

Executive Summary: "Our AI analysis identifies significant portfolio optimization 
opportunities for your Community Bank. By increasing EV share from 18.2% to 25%, 
you could generate an additional $450,000 annually while reducing portfolio climate risk."

Humanized Explanation: "Think of this as upgrading your loan portfolio to be more 
future-ready. The numbers show that customers increasingly want electric vehicles, 
and banks that help them get there first will build stronger relationships and earn 
more revenue. Your community connections make it easier to educate customers about 
new financing options and build trust in sustainable choices."

Quick Actions:
- Launch EV Program (30 days, medium effort, +$125K revenue)
- Improve Data Quality (60 days, low effort, 100% PCAF compliance)
```

### **2. Risk Analysis**
```
Title: "Climate Risk Assessment & Opportunity Analysis"

Key Finding: "Low Transition Risk: Technology transition risk score of 1.8/5"
Impact: "Minimal stranded asset exposure with 5-10 year transition timeline"

Humanized Explanation: "Climate risk might sound complex, but it's really about 
protecting your bank's future. Just as you assess credit risk before making loans, 
climate risk helps you understand how environmental changes might affect your portfolio. 
Your conservative approach to risk management actually works in your favor here - 
climate risks are manageable with proper planning."
```

### **3. Compliance Assessment**
```
Title: "PCAF Compliance Assessment & Improvement Strategy"

Executive Summary: "Your portfolio demonstrates strong PCAF compliance with a 2.8/5 
Box 8 WDQS score, meeting the ‚â§3.0 target. 198 of 247 loans (80.2%) are fully compliant."

Humanized Explanation: "PCAF compliance is like having a clean audit - it shows 
regulators, investors, and customers that you manage your business professionally. 
Your current score of 2.8 is actually quite good - you're already meeting the 
requirements. This puts you ahead of many larger banks and shows your commitment 
to professional standards."
