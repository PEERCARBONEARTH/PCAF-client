# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a unified, production-ready backend system for the PCAF loan management platform. The current system has fragmented backend logic and uses sample data. The goal is to create a cohesive backend API that integrates with the existing frontend, implements all the planned PCAF functionality from the tasks.md file, and replaces all sample data with realistic mock data based on PCAF standards and real-world vehicle loan scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a financial institution user, I want a fully functional backend API that supports all frontend operations, so that I can manage loan portfolios and calculate PCAF-compliant emissions without encountering broken functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the backend SHALL respond with appropriate data and status codes
2. WHEN a user uploads loan data THEN the system SHALL process and store the data with proper validation
3. WHEN a user requests portfolio analytics THEN the system SHALL return calculated PCAF metrics and emissions data
4. WHEN a user accesses any frontend feature THEN the backend SHALL support all required operations without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all backend services to be properly implemented and connected, so that the system works end-to-end without fragmented or missing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN all services SHALL be properly initialized and connected
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the correct schemas and validation rules
3. WHEN external integrations are called THEN they SHALL have proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns and return standardized responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to work with realistic vehicle loan data that reflects actual market conditions, so that I can properly test and validate PCAF calculations and reporting features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is populated with mock data THEN it SHALL include diverse vehicle types, loan amounts, and terms representative of real portfolios
2. WHEN PCAF calculations are performed THEN the mock data SHALL produce realistic emission factors and data quality scores
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL contain meaningful data that demonstrates the system's capabilities
4. WHEN data quality assessments are run THEN they SHALL show varied quality scores reflecting real-world data scenarios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to implement proper PCAF methodology compliance, so that our institution meets regulatory requirements for financed emissions reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emissions are calculated THEN the system SHALL follow PCAF motor vehicle methodology (Section 5.6)
2. WHEN data quality is assessed THEN the system SHALL use PCAF's 1-5 scoring methodology
3. WHEN attribution factors are calculated THEN they SHALL be based on outstanding loan balances and amortization schedules
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL include all required PCAF disclosure elements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a financial institution user, I want the system to handle realistic loan lifecycle events, so that I can track emissions attribution changes over time as loans are paid down or modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loans are created THEN the system SHALL generate proper amortization schedules with payment breakdowns
2. WHEN payments are processed THEN attribution factors SHALL be recalculated based on remaining balances
3. WHEN loans are paid off early THEN the system SHALL handle lifecycle events and update emissions attribution
4. WHEN loan modifications occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails and recalculate schedules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails and data lineage tracking, so that I can demonstrate the accuracy and traceability of our emissions calculations to regulators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL log all changes with timestamps and user information
2. WHEN calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL track the source data and methodology used
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain records of report parameters and generation timestamps
4. WHEN data quality issues are identified THEN the system SHALL log recommendations and track resolution status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want the system to integrate with external data sources for vehicle specifications and emission factors, so that calculations are based on current and accurate reference data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vehicle data is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with vehicle specification databases
2. WHEN emission factors are required THEN the system SHALL use current EPA or regional emission factor databases
3. WHEN external data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use appropriate fallback values and flag data quality impacts
4. WHEN reference data is updated THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to refresh calculations with new factors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want AI-powered insights and recommendations based on my portfolio data, so that I can make informed decisions about emissions reduction and data quality improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the AI insights page THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent analysis of my portfolio using OpenAI's language models
2. WHEN I ask questions about my portfolio THEN the system SHALL use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide contextually relevant answers based on PCAF documentation and my data
3. WHEN data quality issues are identified THEN the system SHALL provide AI-generated recommendations for improvement based on PCAF best practices
4. WHEN I need help understanding PCAF calculations THEN the system SHALL provide natural language explanations using AI-powered chat interface

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to leverage AI for automated compliance checking and regulatory interpretation, so that I can ensure our reporting meets all PCAF requirements without manual review of complex documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN the system SHALL use AI to verify completeness against PCAF requirements
2. WHEN regulatory changes occur THEN the system SHALL use RAG to interpret new requirements and suggest necessary updates
3. WHEN portfolio analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL provide AI-powered insights about compliance risks and opportunities
4. WHEN users need guidance THEN the system SHALL provide conversational AI interface for answering PCAF methodology questions
