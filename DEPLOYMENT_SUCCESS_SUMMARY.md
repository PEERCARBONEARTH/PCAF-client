## üìñ Integration Guide

### **Step 1: Navigation Integration**
Add the RAG Chat to your main navigation:

```typescript
// Add to your navigation component
{
  title: "AI Chat Assistant",
  href: "/financed-emissions/rag-chat", 
  icon: MessageCircle,
  description: "PCAF AI-powered assistance"
}
```

### **Step 2: Enhanced AI Insights Integration**
Add to your portfolio dashboard:

```typescript
import { EnhancedAIInsights } from '@/components/ai/EnhancedAIInsights';

// Usage in your dashboard
<EnhancedAIInsights 
  portfolioData={portfolioData} 
  userRole="risk_manager" // or dynamic based on user
/>
```

### **Step 3: Environment Configuration**
```env
# RAG Configuration
RAG_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7
RAG_MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH=4000
RAG_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT=30000

# AI Service Configuration  
AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=your_ai_service_endpoint
AI_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### **Step 4: Test Sample Queries**
